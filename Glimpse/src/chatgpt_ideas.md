Here are a few ways you could tighten up and future‑proof your Angular app’s architecture, based on the code you’ve got:

---

### 1. **Break up the “God” service**

Right now **BackendGlueService** handles _every_ HTTP call—auth, search, cards, pricing, you name it. That’s a recipe for a massive class that’s hard to test and evolve. Instead, create **feature‑specific services**:

- **AuthService** (`postMagicLink()`, `getVerifyToken()`)
- **SearchService** (`searchCards()`, `getSuggestions()`)
- **CardService** (`getCardDetail()`, `getPriceHistory()` etc.)

Each service does one thing and can be provided in the nearest injector (or root)—making unit tests and refactors far easier.

---

### 2. **Use an HTTP interceptor for auth & global errors**

Rather than manually grabbing `jwtToken` in `getAuthHeaders()` every time and sprinkling `catchError` inside each pipe, spin up an **HttpInterceptor** to:

- Append the `Authorization: Bearer…` header automatically
- Catch 401/500 errors in one place (and route to login or your 404/error page)

This DRYs up the HTTP plumbing and centralizes your error‑handling logic.

**DONE**

---

### 3. **Group by feature (and lazy‑load where it makes sense)**

You already have standalone components, but everything lives at the same “level.” Consider carving out feature folders (and modules, or standalone collections) like:

```
src/app/
  features/
    auth/
      login.component.ts
      verify.component.ts
      auth.service.ts
      auth.routes.ts (or provideRouter forChild)
    search/
      search-start.component.ts
      search-bar.component.ts
      search-result.component.ts
      search.service.ts
    cards/
      card-list.component.ts
      card-detail.component.ts
      card.service.ts
  shared/
    header.component.ts
    footer.component.ts
    error/ four-oh-four.component.ts
    interceptors/
    models/ (barrel exports for your interfaces)
```

Then you can **lazy‑load** heavy chunks (e.g. `/cards/:id`) and speed up initial load.

---

### 4. **Adopt a more predictable state management**

Your `GlimpseStateService` uses a couple of `BehaviorSubject`s for totals and errors, but it’s easy for cross‑component flows to become opaque. If your app grows:

- Look at **NgRx** (with Feature Stores) or
- **ComponentStore** for each domain

…so that side effects (API calls) and state transitions live in well‑typed, testable slices.

---

### 5. **Centralize shared UI & utilities**

Right now header, footer, 404, interfaces, enums, config, routes, etc. are all at root. You could extract a **SharedModule** (or `shared/` folder of standalone widgets) for common pipes, components, and types, and import them into just the features that need them.

---

### 6. **Streamline imports with barrels & consistent naming**

- Create `index.ts` barrel files in each folder so your imports become
  ```ts
  import { SearchService } from "app/features/search";
  ```
  instead of long relative paths.
- Stick to one naming convention (kebab‑case folders + `.component.ts` / `.service.ts`) everywhere.

---

### 7. **Increase test coverage early**

You have a spec for your footer—but nothing else. As you carve out smaller services and modules, add **unit tests** for:

- Each service’s HTTP calls (use `HttpTestingController`)
- Route guards
- Critical component inputs/outputs

---

### 8. **Leverage Angular’s built‑in patterns**

- Use the **AsyncPipe** (`| async`) in templates to subscribe to streams instead of manual `subscribe()` calls.
- Make heavy use of **trackBy** in `*ngFor` for better performance.
- Consider **OnPush** change detection on presentational components to reduce unnecessary re‑renders.

---

By moving toward feature‑driven modules/services, centralized cross‑cutting concerns (interceptors, shared UI) and a clear state‑management strategy, you’ll have an app that’s far easier to navigate, maintain, and scale.
