From within the backend folder (...\Glimpse\backend>) run:

npx nodemon server.js

to start the backend server and have it auto restart on file change.
Looks like I'll still need to refresh the page in the browser, but that's ok

From the Glimpse folder, run:

ng serve

to run the Angular frontend as normal.

VSCode can keep 2 cmd terminals open, so leave one in \Glimpse, and one in \backend



No cards found == same as results screen, but with "no cards found" in place of the image
Too many cards == same layout, "Multiple possible results found, be more specific"
    if possible, show first X suggestions as cards (up to 2x3 grid 2 across 3 down)
    "did you mean one of these? if not, type more"

from card list, clicking on a list item brings you to "details" page
    - similar to results page, but change buttons to count buttons and remove from list
