From within the backend folder (...\Glimpse\backend>) run:

npx nodemon server.js

to start the backend server and have it auto restart on file change.
Looks like I'll still need to refresh the page in the browser, but that's ok

From the Glimpse folder, run:

ng serve

to run the Angular frontend as normal.

VSCode can keep 2 cmd terminals open, so leave one in \Glimpse, and one in \backend



No cards found == same as results screen, but with "no cards found" in place of the image
Too many cards == same layout, "Multiple possible results found, be more specific"
    if possible, show first X suggestions as cards (up to 2x3 grid 2 across 3 down)
    "did you mean one of these? if not, type more"

DONE from card list, clicking on a list item brings you to "details" page
    - similar to results page, but change buttons to count buttons and remove from list

separate number from card name so when it wraps the letters wrap to letters
shrink line height so the second line is closer to the first line than the next item
^ NOPE REJECTED ^
DONE truncate card name when it's too long 

DONE what happens when there's a really long list? scroll bar?
    keep total anchored at the bottom, have the list scroll as needed
    make the div that has the list scroll, keep the rest anchored

DONE backend: when adding card to list, if already in list, just increase count
DONE onItemRemove not working?


oh geez got a bunch done on suggestions page. feels like a mess but my head is all fogged up.



suggestion related cards / frequently used together
