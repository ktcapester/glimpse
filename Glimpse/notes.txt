From within the backend folder (...\Glimpse\backend>) run:

npx nodemon server.js

to start the backend server and have it auto restart on file change.
Looks like I'll still need to refresh the page in the browser, but that's ok

From the Glimpse folder, run:

ng serve

to run the Angular frontend as normal.

VSCode can keep 2 cmd terminals open, so leave one in \Glimpse, and one in \backend
